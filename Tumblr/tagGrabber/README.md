Tag Grabber
============

I am currently learning Python in my spare time. This is by no means complete code. I would like to rewrite what I have so that it is expressed in an Object-Oriented design pattern.

tagGrabber basically does what its name implies. When the user runs it, they can input a single tag - for instance "quote" - and the script will use Tumblr's Search API to grab recent posts that have that tag in their parameters. A JSON file is downloaded and formatted for proper parsing.

Different things can be done with the data. I'm not exactly sure what to use it for yet, but I find that if I run it with "quote" as the query occasionally, then interesting text is produced.

Goals:

* To work on rudimentary Python concepts as time permits
* To familiarize myself with parsing JSON using Python

Using it is rather simple. First download the file. Then open up tagGrabber.py and add your personal Tumblr API key. You can then run the script in your desired terminal or IDE.
