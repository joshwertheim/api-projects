Tag Grabber
============

I am currently learning Python in my spare time. This is by no means complete code. I would like to rewrite what I have so that it is expressed in an OOP design pattern.

Goals:

* To work on rudimentary Python concepts as time permits
* To familiarize myself with parsing JSON using Python

Using it is rather simple. First download the file. Then open up tagGrabber.py and add your personal Tumblr API key. You can then run the script in your desired terminal or IDE.
